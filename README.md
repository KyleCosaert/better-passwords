# Password Generator

## Description

My motivation for the following project was to build a successful password generator website. Constructing a password generator website is helpful for many coders since it is a typical interview project. The password generator website helped me learn javascript, mainly functions, if statements, and prompts. I built this project to test my javascript skills and learn more about functions. The main problem I had to solve in this project was correctly calling functions. Another major issue was adequately executing the random letter, number, and symbol functions. I learned how to use functions in a more straightforward way and also learned a lot about prompts.
